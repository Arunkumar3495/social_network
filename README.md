GridSearchCV
GridSearchCV is a function provided by the scikit-learn library in Python that is used for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning models. It helps you systematically explore the hyperparameter space of a machine learning algorithm to find the best combination of hyperparameters for your specific problem.

Here's how GridSearchCV works:

Define the model: First, you need to choose the machine learning algorithm you want to use and create an instance of it. You can set some initial hyperparameter values, but typically you'll leave them at their default values.

Define the hyperparameter grid: Next, you need to define a dictionary or a list of dictionaries containing the hyperparameters and their possible values that you want to explore. Each key in the dictionary corresponds to a hyperparameter, and the corresponding value is a list of possible values to be tested.

Create the GridSearchCV object: You need to create an instance of GridSearchCV, passing the model and the hyperparameter grid as arguments. You can also specify other optional parameters such as the number of cross-validation folds to use or the scoring metric to optimize.

Fit the GridSearchCV object: Call the fit method of the GridSearchCV object, passing the training data and labels. GridSearchCV will then perform an exhaustive search over the hyperparameter grid, training and evaluating the model for each combination of hyperparameters.

Access the results: After the fit method completes, you can access the results of the hyperparameter search through the best_params_ attribute of the GridSearchCV object. This attribute will contain a dictionary with the best hyperparameter values found during the search. You can also access other attributes such as best_score_, which gives you the best mean cross-validated score achieved during the search.

Use the best model: Once you have the best hyperparameter values, you can create a new instance of the model using those values and train it on the entire training dataset. This model is expected to perform better than the default model or any other combination of hyperparameters you tested.

GridSearchCV is a powerful tool for finding the optimal hyperparameters for your machine learning model. By systematically searching through different combinations of hyperparameters, you can fine-tune your model and improve its performance on your specific task.
